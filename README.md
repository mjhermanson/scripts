# scripts
personal random scripts. run at your own risk. 

create-puppet-environment.sh - creates my local puppet workspace and clones all my modules. Highly specific to how I work but can be modified for anyones usecase.
hostname-dns-sync.sh - can be used to sync a local hostname to whatever is in a DNS lookup. Use case if for something like cron to prevent systems from using localhost.localdomain.
